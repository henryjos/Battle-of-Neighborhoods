ALDI: An OASIS in a Food Desert:

This is an analysis of the food deserts in Chicago and the positive impact that ALDI has had on the food desert status since 2010 by the opening of 7 ALDI's in Chicago food desert neighborhoods since 2010. This project continues by suggesting other food desert locations that the planners at ALDI's might explore for openings in the future.
